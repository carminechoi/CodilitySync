# Contributing to CodilitySync
We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features

## We Develop with Github
We use Github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We Use [Github Flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Github Flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow)). We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions will be understood under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that covers the project.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/carminechoi/CodilitySync/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/carminechoi/CodilitySync/issues); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code
To the best of your ability, include:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce. Be specific!
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

Thorough bug reports will go a long way for us!
